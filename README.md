This repository contains an example implementation of a simple object detection web application using TensorFlow.js and React.js. The app utilizes a pre-trained model to detect objects in images, and is designed to be easy to understand and extend.

This code accompanies the Medium article I authored [Simple Object Detection Using TensorFlow in React â€” Part 1](https://medium.com/@normnolasco/simple-object-detection-using-tensorflow-in-react-part-1-2c62c7e97cb1)

## Features

- Real-time object detection using a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model
- Interactive user interface built with React.js
- Customizable model options for easy adaptation and experimentation
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- Yarn 1.x or higher
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nnolasco/tensorflow-browser-part-1.git
cd tensorflow-browser-part-1
yarn
```

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
